## About Me  

Hi! I'm Luna, also known as xymivza. I’m 16 years old and have lived in **Florida, USA** my whole life. I’m a web developer and computing enthusiast. I also run my own company, **Blooming Applications**, where I specialize in creating **Discord bots** and custom **APIs**.  

I love working on both frontend and backend development, but I’m also really into low-level computing projects like building kernels and operating systems.
